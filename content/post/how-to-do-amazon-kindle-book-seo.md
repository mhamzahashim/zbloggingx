Amazon search engine optimization you hear this phrase thrown around entirely a bit from a lot of the self-publishing experts well I'm going to demystify some of this process and give you a better understanding of the simplicity, but yet complexities of Amazon search engine optimization for your self published books.

Let me know your candid thoughts inside the comments and make sure you stick around to the end because I'm going to share just a little bit of some of the best practices to further increase your placement on the first page in the **amazon search engine**. you will learn how to do Amazon Kindle Book SEO.

But what is [search engine optimization?](https://zblogging.com/what-is-seo/) Everyone now about this so any way why I think we all can agree that we know exactly what search engines are we go over to a particular website be at Google be an Amazon via YouTube.

We type into that search in a query that will bring up relevant results and if you noticed one keyword that I just said "relevancy" ah there we go so we're talking about search engine optimization  should always toss in the word relevancy because

> Relevancy Is Key To Getting Yourself Brought Up In Search Traffic

Regardless of the website, the utilizing and quite frankly Amazon yes is an online retailer, but ultimately, they function best through their **search engine algorithm.**

Now algorithms, of course, is a very delicate way of putting this would be saying.

> An Algorithm Is A Process Or Set Of Rules To Be Followed In Calculations Or Other Problem-solving Operations, Especially A Computer.

It's just a very complicated math situation based on particular variables of the customers buying searching engaging and so on they will be served something based on an outcome.

So, **what exactly bears relevancy?** Well, there are a few things that you can count on that will bring up the relevancy of your book within the Amazon search engine algorithm that's keywords engagement inactivity.

Now you're going to have a lot of people that are going to go ahead and spout their theories about how the **search engine works** and how it functions on Amazon, but ultimately, the team that knows it best is going to be the Amazon algorithm team also known as an **[A9](https://amazonseoconsultant.com/amazon-a9-optimization/).**

If you do a little bit of digging about you, find a website for A9, but unfortunately, they're not really for the coming with the information about what does and what doesn't work on their search engine to get it to where you're **maximizing** the most from the report.

### What Are Some Of The Best Practices For Search Engine Optimizing A Book More Discoverable?

That way, we get it to where we're being served up to our ideal audience, and ultimately they're buying our product, but before I get into this, I want to give a fair warning on this. There are **two robust metrics.**

That works to tie all these things together to get it to work, and I'm going to mention this a little bit closer to the end of the **article** because I think it's important that we don't put the cart in front of a horse.

We have to understand the intricacies of what makes a book more successful on the Amazon platform.

> It's Keywords

A keyword is a single word or a string of words to describe what your **ideal audience** is searching for on the Amazon platform as **an example:**

You can have something as simple as where bears shapeshifter romance?

You know there's going to be an audience that's specifically looking for where bears shapeshifter romance conversely speaking; in other words, someone can look up say "**workout plan,"** but herein lies the problem is that keywords so broad that it's going to in a larger audience.

As in a workout plan for seniors, is it a workout plan for teenagers because we can all agree that a workout plan for teenagers and seniors isn't going to be something, so we're going to start to a niche that keyword down to say.

It could be a gym workout plan for men over 55. You can see how keywords can make or break the success of your book because you don't want to have keywords that aren't related to your book, and once again, we're going to come back to relevancy.

> Only Select Keywords Relevant To Your Book

Because if you've got a keyword **attached to your book** that has no relevance to your audience you're going to either get a lot of people visiting your page and clicking away or be worse yet they buy your product discover it wasn't what they were looking for and give you low reviews impressions clicks and buys.

> Irrelevant Keywords Attract: Disinterested Customer

Now previously, I said in this article that it has a lot to do with **activity and engagement,** and these few little metrics helped to add up in the bigger picture of creating relevancy for your book on the Amazon platform.

So let's say that someone is searching up your book through a given keyword. We're going to kind of circle background say where bears shapeshifter romance and your book is brought up that's what's called an impression.

> Impression: When Amazon Serves your Product in a Search Query

So as the **search engine scrapes** through and says okay, these are the most relevant products to this particular keyword, and people get to scroll through that's what's called an impression, so as your books being served up there, we go.

### What's better than an impression?

Now here's where it gets exciting to make your book a bit more relevant. You need to understand that click what creates the click and what creates the most enticing reason for a person to further explore well naturally a perfect cover is going to be one of the ways that someone goes, huh, and of course, a killer title will help you out as well.

But if you can get book covers dialed in people are going to get the impressions and hopefully stop on your product click on that page and visit that page but what's better than getting feelings and clicks well come on folks, Buys.

When people buy your product that **further increases relevancy** and of course, we all know that it increases your best seller ranking on the Amazon Platform. They are further pushing you up and the relevancy for your given keywords.

## What makes a book more successful on Amazon?

Alright, so this one is a given review and community engagement. Reviews actually will help out in the success of relevancy on the Amazon search engine, and that's why I say reviews should still be part of your overall business model.

It's just. Unfortunately, years past, it used to be the only thing people focused on. They would try to get hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of reviews, and unfortunately, that's great.

But ultimately that's not the **best business model** to go about, and I'm going to share why because those two metrics I told you I'm going to mention here towards the end of the article is why you're going to want to make sure that reviews are an ancillary part it is an important part.

Nonetheless, it needs to be part of that now furthermore a review can be popped into there what helps out with those reviews are a few other things that verify purchase versus unverified purchase reviews.

So there are two different types of reviews the people that have bought your product, and it's proven through Amazon and the people who haven't bought your product and claimed to have purchased in your product and leave a review.

Now there's a lot of speculation, and you can probably search up anywhere on Amazon about the value of **verified purchases versus unverified purchases,** but ultimately, I think we can all agree that Amazon likes to see that you have purchased their product through their platform.

So I believe, and this is my theory that verified purchase reviews carry a bit more weight than unverified purchase reviews they this is a way to sort of say. We can't game the system necessarily as much as doing a false purchase review.

So you can always be like **hey Hamza,** why don't you go and leave me a review while I don't have the excellent book you can go ahead if you've got review privileges to go ahead and pop it on there which I don't recommend, by the way, folks.

**Keywords within the review** here come keywords again; of course, naturally, this is another way that it's going to bring in more eyes to your particular product, and if your customer organically puts it within their review usually, it's going to help out in search engine optimization.

I highly recommend you don't coach up people on **how to do your reviews** or what they need to say because it's, first of all, going to violate their terms of service in their community guidelines.

So you want to make sure you're staying within that's why it's important that if somebody leaves a review, they leave it **organically some keywords** that are related to your book that's going to help out in search engine optimization.

Furthermore, people within the community that have review privileges can comment on those reviews, and also, the other metric is to vote for it is helpful. There used to be the not feature useful, but they have since removed that and reviews can only be left as is or put down as beneficial by the community.

Another metric that further adds to engagement within the Amazon community. **"Social shares,"** there's an excellent reason Amazon perfectly places social sharing buttons on a product page.

They want the audience the browsing audience and the customers to share the products because naturally if you share it over to Facebook or Twitter, someone sees that they reshare it or they come over to that product page and buy that product. This further aids in search engine optimization.

Because again it sends a little signal over to the **Amazon algorithm** where it's like there's some relevancy there's some popularity in this particular product there might be some relevancy to this product too it's given keywords.

So here is another term, **"**Additional indexing." I told you there's going to be two invaluable metrics when it comes to Amazon search engine optimization to your self-published book brand.

## Metric Number One:

**"Balance."** All of those critical features I mentioned from the keywords to the reviews to the [Amazon author central](https://authorcentral.amazon.com/) and so much more require a balance as I said before in the review gathering process I told you that the author's before used to gather reviews and they didn't spend enough time on the other metrics.

What ends up happening it becomes unfairly balanced you're not focusing on one of the keywords that are driving people in there how can you build relevancy to that what else can you do to optimize your listing on Amazon metric further.

## Metric Number Two

**"Consistency"** is key again I'm gonna go back over to the whole review gathering process some people will go for an incredible book launch they'll have hundreds if not thousands of downloads within a day or purchases of their print book.

But that is good for **short-term success ultimately** though the Amazon algorithm seems to enjoy and prefer consistency is crucial, so it's better that you instead of having 100 downloads in a given day ten downloads per day throughout say 90 days.

It's going to be consistency now nothing wrong with you doing 100 downloads or purchases within a given day for the **next 90 days** overall it's all about consistency and especially when it comes to things like keywords that match with your brand impressions clicks and buys reviews coming in regularly social shares.

That is what it all comes down to some metric number one balance, metric number two consistency. Now I hope you liked this information, so please share this with others because sharing is caring, and if you have any other questions, please leave a comment below.
