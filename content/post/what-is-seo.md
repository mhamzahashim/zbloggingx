When we perform a search, for example, in Google, we see a list of different results. Usually, we look at the first results. And if we want our business to appear in a good position, how do we get it? The answer is **SEO**. But the question is, **What is SEO?**

In this article, I will discover what the acronym SEO stands for. They come from the English "**Search Engine Optimization**" and could be translated as "**Search engine optimization**," that is, their role is to position the different websites to ensure the user the best results, those that best suit their needs.

### How do search engines work?

Understanding and understanding how search engines work is essential to be able to carry out a successful strategy. First, always keep in mind that search engines meet the information needs of users. The results are updated regularly using algorithms, which means that the positions can change.

### Relevancy

If you search for “chocolate chip cookie recipes,” you don’t want to see web pages about truck tires. That’s why Google looks first-and-foremost for pages that are closely related to your keyword. However, Google doesn’t merely rank “the most relevant pages at the top.” That’s because there are thousands (or even millions) of relevant pages for every search term.

**For example, the keyword “cookie recipes” brings up 349 million results in Google:**

### Who benefits SEO?

SEO offers different benefits and utilities. It is essential to understand that not all businesses use this tool with the same objective, and therefore the strategies will not be the same; there is no strict guideline to follow.

We must generate searches for the product or service that we offer, for example, if we have a very novel product, and therefore, nonexistent for our possible target audience; they will not be made, that is why we need to carry out marketing actions in advance. To know.

Therefore, we must avoid using the SEO tool as an independent strategy, that is, it must be integrated into our marketing plan. Achieving total cohesion of all our actions will ensure that we make the objectives set.

## Why Is SEO Important?

In short: search is a BIG source of traffic. Here’s a breakdown of **[where most website traffic originates](https://sparktoro.com/blog/the-powerhouses-of-the-internet-are-turning-hostile-to-websites/ "Where most traffic originates"):**

As you can see, nearly 60% of all traffic on the web starts with a **Google search**. And if you add together transport from other popular search engines (like Bing, Yahoo, and YouTube), 70.6% of all traffic originates from a **search engine.**

### Types of SEO:

Search engine optimization is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic, increasing visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine. SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results and excludes the purchase of paid placement.

In the Digital Marketing Industry, Search Engine Optimization **(SEO)** is the central part. There are mainly three types of SEO. **White Hat SEO, Grey Hat SEO and Black Hat SEO (Negative SEO).** You can find so many **Introduction of [Black Hat SEO](https://zblogging.com/category/black-hat-seo/)** on the internet, but I’m writing about the latest change and moreover new things in it.

**White hat SEO** techniques, on the other hand, adhere to Google Webmaster Guidelines but usually take longer and cost more to carry out. White hat SEO carries far less risk and tends to deliver lasting and compounding value over time.

You’ll find most of the respected SEO and **content marketing companies** like **Moz, Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Watch, Search Engine Land, Search Engine Roundtable, Backlinko, Neil Patel** the **SEM Post, Stone Temple, GSQI, and Philadelphia-area Seer Interactive and SEMRush** all use and recommend white hat SEO tools and techniques.

**Grey hat SEO** falls somewhere in the middle as these tactics are not explicitly called out in **Google’s Guidelines.** You should be cautious about taking this path as it is not safe to assume that just because a specific technique isn’t labeled or mentioned as being deceptive and one that will get you into trouble, that it will not interfere **negatively with your rankings. Google says:**

> Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.

**Black hat SEO** refers to a set of practices that are used to increases a site or **page’s rank in search engines** through means that violate the **search engines’ terms of service.** The name “**Black Hat**” originated in Western movies to distinguish the “bad guys” from the “good guys,” who wore white **hats** (see white **hat SEO**).

#### There are two types of **SEO**

**[On-Page SEO](https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-site-seo)**
