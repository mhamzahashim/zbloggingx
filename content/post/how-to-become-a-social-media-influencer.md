I have over 32,000 Facebook fans. I have over a few 10,000 Twitter followers. I have over a thousand people reading my blog, every single month. Today I'm going to teach you, **How to Become a Social Media Influencer.** These days there's Instagram, there's Facebook, there's YouTube. There are channels everywhere.

And you know what, they're crowded, everyone's already on 'em. So, **how are you gonna stand out,** and become famous? And I know, you'll be like, **"No, no, no I don't care to be famous."** But yes, you really do. And it is overrated. I'm not that famous but enough people know about me, and I can generate millions of dollars because of my personal brand, and you know what, it's not that hard, you can do the same too.

## 1. Be Consistent

So, here's the first thing you need to know. You have to be consistent. I don't care if you're producing content like blog posts, or videos or podcasts. **You have to be consistent**. And I'm not talking about being consistent by like publishing one article a week or one video a week. I'm talking about doing this for years and years. People like me, **Gary Vaynerchuk, Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki, Tim Ferriss.** We didn't build our brands overnight.

Sure, a lot of those guys are way more famous than me, and you know what, they've been doing this a lot longer. So what does that tell you? You have to be doing this consistently. People look at **[Gary Vaynerchuk](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/)**, does he do an amazing job? Of course, he does. But it didn't with being immediate Gary Vaynerchuck. It started with wine library.

He was getting on Conan **O'Brien**, putting socks on Conan's mouth, and be like, "Look, this wine tastes like dirt and socks, "try it, Conan." And then he would try it, and then be like, "Oh, cool." Gary built up his brand over the last 10 years, it didn't happen overnight.

I built up my brand over the last 10 years, it didn't happen overnight. Guy Kawasaki started off as Apple's evangelist back in the day. Again, it didn't happen overnight. **So you need to be consistent.**

## 2. Leverage Different Media

The second thing you need to do is leverage different media types. You can try video, you can try **blogging**, you can try podcasting. But you have to be everywhere. some people prefer videos, some people wanna listen while they drive, some people wanna read because it's quicker and easier for them to digest. And I didn't believe this before, I used to the only blog.

And when I only blog, a lot of people will be like, "Harold, can you write **shorter blog posts**, they are too long."And I was like, "Well if I write a shorter blog post, "I'm not gonna **[get much Google traffic](https://zblogging.com/free-website-traffic/)**, "So that's not gonna work." But then my **buddy Eric** was like, **"Harold,** we should produce a podcast." And we started creating one called Marketing School, and it gets over a half a million listens, each and every single month.

And now people are telling me, "Oh, **I love [Marketing School](https://marketingschool.io/)**, I can listen to it, "while I'm driving to work, "and I can get my daily dose of marketing advice "without reading your content. "It's so much better for me." And I was like,

"Oh, this sucks, you're not gonna read the content?" And they were like, "Well, I don't have that much time," and the audio is way easier." And then I started creating videos, like the one you're watching. And people were like, "Oh, I love the videos, "it's so much easier, I can see the tips on the screen, "easier to follow along, and it's way more actionable.

It's much better than the blog content, and I prefer it over the audio, "cause I want more actionable tips." The point I'm trying to make is, every single person is different. You need to create different content types so you can appeal to everyone.

## 3. Engage with your Community

The next tip I have for you is engaging with your community. When you leave a comment, I respond. Don't believe me? Leave a comment right now with a question, and I bet you, I'll respond. That's how I engaged I am, I care about you. If you don't care about other people and you're not going to help them out, don't expect to build a brand and a community of people willing to follow you. It's all about **reciprocating.**

I truly enjoy helping other people, and you should too. If you don't enjoy what you're doing, and you don't care for others, then don't do it. Don't be that fake person, truly care for what you're doing. It really matters because it shows in the quality of your work. When I respond to someone and they say thanks, of course, I'm gonna respond back, with a short comment like thanks.

But I still respond to let them know I'm here, listening to them. But when they ask a really detailed question, I'm here with a detailed response. Why? Because a short response shows I don't care, and it won't help them. Really care, and engage and respond.

## Meet with People

The last tip I have for you is to meet people in person. If you notice with people **Neil Patel**, **Tim Ferriss, Gary Vaynerchuk**, **Brian Dean,** go to conferences, the network, they speak at events. And when you're first starting out, and you wanna speak at an event, they're not gonna pay you, that's okay. They may not accept you, that's okay. But if you apply, it's a numbers game.

You're not gonna be an overnight success unless your company is an overnight success, which is rare. So, if this blog post helped you, make sure you share it with your friends. Because sharing is caring.
