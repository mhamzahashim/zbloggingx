Before learning advanced techniques, you have to learn basic On Page Optimization Techniques. So I'm going to shared a complete checklist that will be very helpful for you.

## What is On Page SEO?

On Page SEO is one of the most important parts to rank your websites, and although it often goes unnoticed or is not given too much importance, it is really much more powerful than we can imagine.

As a definition in general terms, we can say that on page SEO is the optimization of our own web page, that is, it is something that is within our reach and it is in our hands to optimize it.

## Keyword Research

A very important part of on page SEO is **[finding the right keywords](https://zblogging.com/how-to-find-right-keywords-for-your-niche/)** for which we want to our site in search engines. If you choose the right keywords, you will get a good result. The best keyword is that which:

* Is relevant to the main topic. The keyword should be an accurate description of your content.
* Is regularly searched by your target audience. The search volume for the keyword is large enough to drive traffic to your site.
* Is within your site’s **competitive power**. Your site has enough authority to rank above other sites already ranking for that keyword.

This is essential because if we do not choose the keywords well we will be wasting time, our money, and resources in appearing in the first places of some keywords that later will not attract enough visitors and the few that come will not be profitable.

In other words, before starting to work on the SEO of a website, we must do a keyword study, seeing which are the words that more visitors can give us and ensuring that those keywords will also attract customers interested in our **products and services.**

**For Example:** If someone searches a keyword that **"best gaming PCs for kids**" and you are working on the keyword **"laptops for kids",** there's so much difference between these two keywords. You have to choose a specific keyword according to your article. Also, use relevant keywords in your articles because it helps in ranking. When

## What is a Landing Page?

The landing page is the page that we will create to rank the specific keywords. Your landing page should be user and search engine friendly since it has to be a website of interest and according to the search, that you are going to rank for.

**For example:** if we rank our site on the keyword **“minivan cars”** we cannot take those users to a landing page of **“off-road cars”** since the user is not looking for that and therefore when he lands on that page his instant action will be to close the web. Because the user does not found what they were looking for. For this reason, the landing page is very important.

## Meta Tags and URL

## 1. Optimizing the Meta Title

The meta title is the title that we put on our **website** and that therefore will appear in the Google search engine. It is one of the most important **[SEO ranking factors](https://zblogging.com/most-important-ranking-factors-in-google/)**. Most people don't focus on this and it's a golden chance for you if your competitor is also missing this point.

It is very important that the keywords that we want to rank should be in the meta title. Since this will be a signal for search engines to give these words greater relevance and better positioning.

On the other hand, as it is the title that will appear in Google search results, it is important that users see those keywords they are looking for so that they can check that on your website they will find what they are looking for, and therefore click on your result.

## 2. Optimizing the Meta Description

The meta description has been losing more and more value in terms of **web positioning**, but it does not hurt that within it the keywords that we want to position appear in this way to give them a little more relevance. Every page should have a unique meta description with the main keyword included.

In addition to this, it is very important that we try to put a very striking description with a good **“CTA”** (call to action) that makes users interested in your result and therefore enter your website.

## 3. Is the Meta Keywords useful?

Google no longer uses meta keywords as a ranking signal. Add keywords to your title tag to boost **click-throughs** and rankings. Similar to the title tag, sprinkling keywords to meta descriptions can boost **[CTR](https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate)**.

The meta keywords are a totally outdated tag and it doesn't really do anything for SEO today. Therefore, it is best to eliminate it and not use it since if it is not going to give us any benefit it would be a waste of time to use it or optimize it as it was done a few years ago.

## 4. URL Structure

This is one of the most important parts of on-page SEO. The URLs have to have a friendly structure, that is, it is not recommended to add strange **characters, punctuation marks, etc**., in the URL. The ideal is to create addresses that are readable and contain the keywords that we want to position.

**An example of a friendly URL would be the following:**

https://zblogging.com/what-is-seo (Exact and Right Structure)\
https://zblogging.com/?p=123 **(Wrong)**https://zblogging.com/2020/10/08/sample-post/ **(Wrong)**

## **Landing Page Content**

## 1. Heading

Heading important information for Google to identify the content. They range from H1, H2, H3 to H6, the first three really is the most important.

The H1 tag is the most important in **seo page optimization.** It is the one that should appear at the top of the web and where we should try to include the keywords that we want to rank in order to give them greater relevance.

The H2 tag is less important but it can also be useful to use with secondary keywords that we want to position. Use your primary or relative keywords in **H2 headings.**

## 2. Keywords Proximity

If you want to rank a keyword, you have to optimize your content on those particular keywords plus more relative queries related to that keyword. That way you can create relevancy in content. It is one of the most most important SEO factors.

## 3. Internal Linking

Internal links are very important when it comes to **on-page activities in SEO.** Since you can link your internal sections with the exact texts that you want to position and in this way, you will give those internal sections greater relevance for those keywords.

Normally we usually link from the most important pages such as the main page to the sections that we want to give relevance and better positioning. By doing it this way, we are going to shift part of the importance of the home page to the **linked sections**.

## 4. External Linking

It may be interesting to mention other important websites in the sector, as we will be making a reference to websites of authority and already positioned, which in the eyes of search engines means that we want the best possible content and we take as a reference to the best.

## 5. Website Loading Speed

The speed with which our website loads is a factor that has become increasingly important, so it is very important to optimize it to the maximum of our possibilities. The less time it takes to load our website, the better since the user will also be more satisfied.

For this, we can reduce in kilobytes the size of the images that we are using, avoid the use of flash and heavy technologies, reduce the **[HTML and CSS code](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss)** that does not have any function, avoid the use of javascript and if it is used, try to load it at end of the web, etcetera.

There are many tools like Pingdom, GTmetrix or like Google Page Speed that can help us with this task. These tools will help you to identify the points that needed to be fixed to increase **page speed**.

## 6. Improving CTR (Click Through Rate)

Now, what is the CTR? The definition of CTR, in general, we can say that it is the **percentage of clicks** that users make from search engines to our website.

The more clicks they make on our result, the better CTR we are going to get, and therefore in relation to Google we will have a much more interesting result for users, which will improve our positioning.

## How to Click-Through Rate?

The best way to increase the CTR is going to be making the meta title and meta description more striking since they are the only visible parts when we appear in search engines.

Our task will be to get the best **"call to action"** possible so that they click on our website. This will depend to a large extent on the theme that we work on since depending on the theme and the keywords, users will search for one thing or another.

Therefore we are going to have to put ourselves in the shoes of a user to try to find out what exactly they need and what they want to find, in this way we will be able to get the best call to action possible.

## Conclusions

SEO is a fundamental part to take into account on our websites since thanks to it we will be able to get a large number of visitors directly from search engines such as Google.

For this reason, we must take advantage of the strategies that are within our reach, such as On-page SEO, and optimize it in the best possible way. In this way, we are going to differentiate ourselves from our competition and gain a fundamental advantage that will rank our keyword in the first position.
