In the Digital Marketing Industry, there are many services and things like social media marketing, **[Influencer Marketing](https://zblogging.com/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer/)**, Content Marketing, Mobile Marketing & Advertising and SEO. But Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the main part of the Digital Industry. Basically There are main 3 types of SEO. 

* White Hat SEO
* Grey Hat SEO 
* Black Hat SEO (Negative SEO)

You can find so many Introduction of Black Hat SEO on the internet but I'm writing about the latest change and moreover new things in it.

**White hat SEO** techniques, on the other hand, adhere to Google Webmaster Guidelines but usually take longer and cost more to carry out. White hat SEO carries far less risk and tends to deliver lasting and compounding value over time.

You’ll find most of the respected SEO and content marketing companies like 

* **Moz**
* **Search Engine Journal**
* **Search Engine Watch**
* **Search Engine Land**
* **Search Engine Roundtable**
* **Backlinko**
* **Neil Patel**
* **SEMRush**
* **Ahrefs** and so on...

All of them uses this strategy and recommend white hat SEO tools and techniques.

**Grey hat SEO** falls somewhere in the middle as these tactics are not specifically called out in **Google’s Guidelines.** You should be cautious about taking this path as it is not safe to assume that just because a specific technique isn’t labeled or mentioned as being deceptive and one that will get you into trouble, that it will not interfere negatively with your rankings. In fact, Google says:

> Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.

**Black hat SEO** refers to a set of practices that are used to increases a site or page's rank in search engines through means that violate the search engines' terms of service**.** The term "**Black Hat**" originated in Western movies to distinguish the "bad guys" from the "good guys," who wore white hats (see white hat SEO).

> There are many techniques that are similar in all types of **[SEO](https://zblogging.com/seo/)** but some are different. Today I'm going to tell you the **Introduction of Black Hat SEO.**

Over the years, Google has very cleverly made it seem more and more that those who choose to do **[Black Hat SEO](https://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo)** will inevitably face Google’s wrath, and it is almost to the point that it is pointless to ever try or learn about the black hat.

## **Now that sentence has a very important word in it Seem** 

The very real reality is that Black Hat SEO is still alive and kicking in almost every major **SERP** you check today. Yes, there may be any number of **case studies** of people getting their sites to hit, but most of those can be down to lack of knowledge and human error.

In this series, I’ll be running you through my own findings based on patents, case studies and experiments we’ve been trawling through for the past 6 months – In preparation for the **[Chiang Mai SEO Conference.](https://chiangmaiseoconference.com/)**

At first, I thought I’d just be releasing the contents of these findings to the members of the conference. However, I thought as it is in a location some may not be able to easily get to, that I’d release it in the form of a mini eBook series for y’all to enjoy.

Here’s a quick break down of each section of this series, so you can easily skip to the bits you’re most interested in. Don’t worry**,** this series doesn’t HAVE to be read in sequential order... Though I’d appreciate it if you went through the entirety of my findings.
