Within the content generation, the **e-book format** is becoming more and more relevant, it is used for both companies and individuals and is the typical format that everyone wants to read and at the same time everything they want to do. In the last 12 months through this blog, I have created several e-books, some free and some paid.

In both scenarios, the experience has been great, although I want to clarify that it is a work that takes a lot of time. Through this post and a downloadable template, I want to summarize how you can create good ebooks. So today I'm going to share **How to create a good ebook in 10 steps.**

## How to Create an Ebook in 10 Steps

I recommend following this order instead of focusing first on the most typical of the first index, title and cover design. So let's start.

## **1. Define the basics to create an e-book**

Define the basic information about the topic before creating an e-book. Like if you want to create an ebook on SEO then explain something like that SEO is the abbreviation of **[Search Engine Optimization](https://zblogging.com/what-is-seo/)**.

* Why do you want to make an e-book?
* What are you going to talk about, this is the most important thing, this will depend on the success of your e-book
* Who is the e-book for?
* What other e-books exist of the subject you have selected

## 2. Define a boot Scheme

* **Pose the outline of your content, what works best for e-books**

  * Introduction
  * Problem (topic)
  * Solution (this is where most of your content will be)
  * Tools
  * recommendations
  * Sources
* Create an initial index following the scheme (initial because you know how it will start but not how it will end)

## 3. Plan your Times

If you make an **e-book without time**, two things can happen to you:

* Your content rusts because new things will come out when you finish
* You will last much longer than if you set limits

Create an email campaign and ask your readers that you are launching something in **ebook format.** That is why my recommendation is that you do planning that includes at least the following:

* Date to write half of the e-book
* Deadline to edit and make changes to the final result of the e-book
* Date to prepare cover design
* Deadline to publish

## 4. Research before you start writing

If you want to move faster you will have to investigate a lot before you start writing and when you start writing, investigate further to confirm that everything you share is 100% true. Some recommendations for this would be:

* Subscribe to related blogs
* Read related books
* Read the books that can be competition
* Look for references that add value to your e-book

## 5. Start writing

This is when the best part comes, to begin to capture your knowledge acquired with your profession and your research. My recommendation for this part is that you never forget:

* Your deadlines
* Set distractions aside
* Add visual content every 6-8 paragraphs
* Confirm what you write if you have doubts
* Be decisive with what you write
* Believe in what you share

## 6. Finish your e-book and ask for an opinion

Lean on colleagues and referents to have a look at your e-book and give you their respective feedbacks. The part of finishing the e-book includes:

* Spelling Check
* Review of disaggregated topics
* Final Index Review

## 7. Complete the rest of an e-book

When your content is perfect you have to check other parts of the e-book such as:

* Introduction
* Conclusions
* Biography
* Recommended links
* Commercial info

## 8. E-book cover design

This is when the challenge of visually summarizing the content of your book comes, there are people who do not get complicated and simply use good typography and a good background. Whatever the form you will have to include here the following data (at least):

* Title
* Short description
* Author
* Company (if applicable)

## 9. Launch your e-book

I keep for another post the promotion plan for an e-book but I take this to recommend some actions:

* Create a post or landing page to offer the free book
* Define the mechanics to download the book
* Send a newsletter to your subscribers
* Publish the e-book in **[RSS Feed](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-rss-how-to-use-rss-in-wordpress/)**
* Create a banner

## 10. Analyze the success of your e-book

Since you launch your e-book you will have to monitor the effectiveness of all actions and especially the download number. The **beginnings are usually good,** so you will have many downloads at the beginning, when this descends you will have to implement new techniques to re-activate your downloads. The most common data to track are:

* Number of downloads
* Number of page visits where the e-book is
* Number of downloads vs the number of visits
* The virality of the e-book in RRSS (Social Share)
* Positive e-book comments

I hope that with these 10 steps you can **prepare your e-book** successfully. I hope you liked this information so please share these steps with others and let me know if you want to ask anything more.
