The first Chrome extension in my list is **SEOquake.** This is such a great tool for analyzing your competitors ranking in their organic search results. It also gives you a great idea as to what is displayed, and what paid ads your competitors are running, and which keywords they are targeting.\

It also has a SERP popover feature that shows you the domain and page-level metrics for the ranking results. And if you click on a link when browsing a website, you'll be able to see the ads they're running. It is one of the best SEO chrome extensions.

It also has a page analysis feature that allows you to get a review of the title, the description, and even the Schema mark-up of a page and they have many more page level features as well.

Its has a new feature, whenever you search a query on Google, it will show all the metrics of your competitors and the difficulty of the keyword you searched. It's such an amazing tool. Give it a try.

## **3. BuzzStream**

The third Chrome extension is BuzzStream. It's an amazing tool for outreach, networking, guest posting, and link building. If you want to find guest post opportunities, this extension is build speecialy for you. This will crawl any site that you visit and pull out the contact details for the people associated with the site; this will help you find editors, reporters, content marketers.\
\
I love using this when I'm on a **news website or a big,** heavy content website and I'm trying to figure out who I can reach out to when I want to either build a link, and I'm trying to convince them to link to me, or I'm trying to figure out who the editor is because I want to contribute a guest post.

## 4. TubeBuddy - Best Chrome Extension

The next extension, **TubeBuddy**. Amazing extension for your video marketing strategy. When you're viewing any **video on YouTube**, it'll show you the tags, the view counts, and so much more.\
\
Even better, when you upload your own video it'll help suggest tags to you, and help you optimize the metadata associated with the video that you just uploaded.\
\
This is really important because when you're uploading a video, even though I have tools like Ubersuggest, which is free, do you really want to keep going back to Ubersuggest.

Or any other **keyword research tool** and many figures out and then go back to YouTube and then go input that data? No, you want it all right there, and **that extension** will help you do that.

## 5. Buffer - Social Media Growth Tool

The fifth extension I have for you is Buffer. This is great for personal branding and growing your authority as you can seamlessly post content to your followers as you broad and read your favorite blogs. So when I'm on a site, let's say, **zBlogging**, I like something, through the Buffer **Chrome extension**. I can click a button, and it can go and get shared out to all my social profiles.\
\
Not only does that help me keep up-to-date with all my **social media profiles,** but it allows me to keep building all my audience on all these social platforms, without really doing much work. A lot of people are like, "Oh, I got to update my "Twitter profile, my Facebook, I got to keep going to "All these platforms and manually put in content."\
\
Wouldn't it just be easier if you're just reading content, you click a button and boom, you can schedule it for later**,** and it goes into your promotional calendar. Well, you can do that with the Buffer extension**.**

## 6. Email Finder - AeroLeads

**[AeroLeads](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-finder-aeroleads/fcpepipgmkkjnljechjjimkaondedmbe?hl=en)** is an amazing google chrome extension if you are in search of leads to promote your brand. This tool gives you full access to acquiring potential client’s email Id’s, Contact numbers, business details, and much more to nurture leads and convert them to sales.

I personally like this tool to get email IDs and contact numbers while building my email - marketing list. It also helps you to confine all the business credentials to a consolidated CSV file that you can play around within various **CRM platforms**.

Though you can access the few data points for free with AeroLeads, there are certain limits in the free version. A handy tool helping you in reaching your audience, entice email marketing and allowing to collect ideal prospects of leads from all areas.

If you are in search of business customers to generate leads and to promote your brand, I would say go for AeroLeads.

## 7. Grammarly - Content Making Tool

The sixth extension I have for you is Grammarly. It's actually my favorite extension**,** period, on Chrome, altogether. The reason I love this is when I'm doing **marketing-based emails** or any work, and I do a ton through my email inbox, or even I'm writing a blog post in WordPress, it'll tell me any spelling mistakes.\
\
Now, Grammarly does have a paid version as well. I use the free one. The free one gives you enough value where you can figure out what changes you need to make to have amazing grammar and no spelling issues.\
\
Heck, I myself type up my blog posts in Microsoft Word, and when I copy and paste them over into **WordPress**, I find that Grammarly catches all the errors that Microsoft Word doesn't even catch. It's so much better, and you guys have to check out that plug-in.

## 8. BuzzSumo - Content Marketing Tool

The seventh extension that you got to check out is **BuzzSumo**. It's an amazing extension for content creators. It'll give you an idea of what content works in your niche.\
\
For example, any page you visit, let's say a competitor's site**,** it'll tell the **social media engagement**, how many **social shares,** unique page use, and other items like that, and even backlinks.\
\
It helps you target, in real-time, what type of content you should be producing versus what type of content you shouldn't be producing.

## 8. Save to Pocket - Save Bookmarks

The eighth Chrome extension I have for you is **Save to Pocket.** This is super important in a role where there's an endless amount of information. It's easy to get distracted while researching for your next article, or building out your content strategy.\
\
Having a browser with dozens of tabs open can be distracting and hurt your productivity. For content creators and folks with large social followings, this is also a great tool for you, because you can save amazing content that you'll want to share later on with your audience.

## 9. Check my Links

The eigth extension is that you should use is Check My Links. This tool is essential for a link building strategy. It'll show you which links are working properly, and which ones are broken for any page that you visit.\
\
Let's say that you're on a page of someone linking to a competitor and that link is broken. Wouldn't you want to hit them up and convince them to **link back to you?** That's why you want to do this.\
\
Broken links are one of the easiest and simplest ways to convince people to link to you, and this extension will help you find all those broken link opportunities.

## 10. Keywords Everywhere

It is one of the best extension for an SEO Expert and it's a paid extension. It cost not much just in $10, you can get 100,000 credits and one search takes 1 credit only, that means it is enough for you to use while doing keyword research.
