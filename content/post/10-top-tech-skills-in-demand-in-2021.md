## Top Tech Skills in Demand in 2021

## **1. Machine Learning**

Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if machines could learn from data.

The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they can independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It’s a science that’s not new – but one that has gained fresh momentum.

While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development.

## **2. Web Development**

Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization.

## **5. Data Engineering**

Information engineering, also known as Information technology engineering, information engineering methodology or data engineering, is a software engineering approach to designing and developing information systems.

## **6. UI/UX Design**

User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience.

## **7. Cyber-security**
