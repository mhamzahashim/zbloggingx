If you say WordPress SEO**,** you mean Yoast SEO**.** It is the most widely used SEO optimization WordPress plug-in using worldwide. But why do most WordPress website administrators choose Yoast SEO, and do they not look for an alternative? Because there are enough (free). There is one Best Alternative To Yoast Seo available in the industry.

## What is SEO?

**SEO,** which stands for **[Search Engine Optimization,](https://zblogging.com/what-is-seo/)** is a term used when it comes to indexing and optimizing a website for search engines. So basically, how findable you are for others on the web. It is a relevance check on the **quality and quantity** of the content that you post on your webpage.

Structure and relevance play a significant role in indexing your website, and to help you with this, there are several [Free SEO Tools](https://zblogging.com/free-seo-tools-for-wordpress/). In this article, I will compare a relatively new SEO tool that is the Best Alternative To Yoast Seo.

## Yoast SEO vs. RankMath

As mentioned, [RankMath](https://rankmath.com/) is a new player in the SEO market, but that does not mean that RankMath is necessarily worse or less developed.

It is true that in the past, there were a few bugs when optimizing your content, but they had free 24/7 support for that, unlike Yoast SEO. You can chat with them via Facebook or by mail. You will receive support immediately via Facebook, and it will take a maximum of 2 hours via email.

All bugs have now been fixed for a while, and RankMath continues to develop by adding more and more functions. But I'm going to talk about the differences that matter.

## Schema Markup

**Schema Markup** is simply a piece of code that tells Google what you post and **how you want to be indexed.** This can be a news article such as that of the NOS, but it can also be a recipe or a product. With a [schema snippet,](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) you can ensure that your item, product, or method is more clearly recognized and that you come up higher in search engines.

Unfortunately, Yoast SEO does not have this option even in the paid version, and you have to make do with external plug-ins or codes. And for those who don't know much about systems, it is impossible to do, and it does not happen automatically. RankMath, on the other hand, automatically arranges all of this for you. So you don't have to worry about it.

## The possible schedule snippets are:

* **Article or Blog**
* **Book**
* **Class**
* **Event**
* **Music**
* **Product**
* **Recipe**
* **Restaurant or another location**
* **Service**
* **Person**
* **Application and more**

## What are Statistics?

With RankMath, you can view **all your data in the plug-in itself,** which gives you more insight into **how your content is valued by Google** and through which keywords people came to your website.

### **We can divide the statistics into three parts:**

**Google Search Console Integration:**

You can easily link your business email address that is linked to your domain (**customer service@domain.com**) during the set-up process, so you don't have to mess with HTML codes. You also do not have to search for your Google Webmaster verification code again. Here you get Google analytics figures, only less comprehensive.

## **Full page SEO score:**

At RankMath, you can **[analyze your entire website](https://rankmath.com/tools/seo-analyzer/)** and view your SEO score. You will also receive an extensive list of tips and tricks to improve your score. Here we mainly look at fundamental, social media and advanced SEO. But your security and your website speed (performance) are also covered.

Do you want to know which **keywords do best on your page?** Then RankMath has the **SEO keyword ranking.** The functionalities do not lie. You see your most used keywords and how they do it. This is useful if you want to advertise on a keyword**. (This feature is under customization).**

### Other Benefits

RankMath has a **user-friendly interface**. The RankMath setup wizard is easier to understand because each option has a brief explanation and below which code you should see there. Yoast SEO uses a somewhat old-fashioned set-up wizard with which there is certainly nothing wrong with it.

At RankMath, you can choose whether all images and videos of, **For example**, your products want to be labeled with your own alt text. By adding an alt text, you ensure that when potential customers search for men's shoes, they will see the images of your product.

So you get the same title for a product as the alt text. Instead of "IMG-003", your product image will receive "Hugo Boss men's pants" as alt text. You can then be found on it.

**External link management** shows how often your links are referred to in the texts of other websites. At RankMath, you can immediately see how often your blog has been referred to. This is useful for link building.

At Yoast SEO, you must necessarily have a premium paid account, while with RankMath, you don't have to. It's all free! With so many features, even Yoast SEO does not have in the paid version. The best Alternative To Yoast Seo is Rank Math.

With Yoast SEO, you can only choose one focus keyword with a free account and with Yoast SEO premium a few. At RankMath, you can select up to 5 focus keywords. Your SEO score is also not assessed from insufficient to good, but you get a more precise score from 1 to 100.

It also has a Redirection feature that will redirect your broken link to your homepage or where you want users to send it. Yoast SEO does not have this feature. One of the Best Alternative To Yoast Seo is Rank Math because of its amazing features.
