## Here are 7 Steps on How to Get Traffic from Facebook Groups

## 1. Optimize your Facebook Page for Clicks.

First and foremost, people can’t click through to your website if they can’t find the link – to put it everywhere that makes sense. Fill in all the details like your about page, website link, phone number, and all the kinds of stuff. That will help visitors to engage with you directly.

## 2. Have a Steady Stream of fresh content on your Website.

Posting funny pictures, cat videos, and links to news and educational articles are great ways to entertain your fans but they don’t drive traffic to your website. How can you post about your website all the time when there’s only so much to see – and so much to say about it?

Blogging is your answer. A steady stream of fresh content gives you something to promote on Facebook, gives your followers something interesting to read, and keeps them coming back for more.

## 3. Optimize your content for shares.

You don’t have to do *all* the heavy lifting! Once you have a blog that is regularly updated with fresh content, make it easy for other people to share on Facebook.

Including social sharing buttons provides a one-step way for people to send your content with a link to your website to their own Facebook timeline for their friends to see and hopefully click.

## 4. Use big images

Using big images on your website and blog gives Facebook something to pull in when you (or your readers!) share a link (see #6 below) – and they make the page attractive for the user after they’ve clicked through. A good rule of thumb for images that look good on Facebook is to set their dimensions to 1200 x 628.

## 5. Craft compelling text.

The text you include with your link could win – or lose – the click. You want to describe the content in enough detail to give readers a reason to leave Facebook in favor of clicking to your site without sounding spammy.

## 6. Use Facebook’s Link Share view.

A lot of Page administrators – including us – used to share links by uploading a big, pretty picture, then putting the link in the status update. It seems logical, given that photos do well.

## 7. Advertise.

The easiest way to get your Facebook posts in front of your desired audience is to put a little money in. Facebook has a ton of options when it comes to targeting your ads, including getting more reach among your current fans; showing an ad only to local pet owners who don’t already like your Page, and even showing it to people who like your competition.

You can start advertising for as little as $5 and there are lots of reports and measures to show you what kind of return you’re getting.
