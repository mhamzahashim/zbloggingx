Welcome to my resources page. I’ve been blogging for over five years now and have used various tools and products for my blogs. This page is a list of all the products I use these tools because they make my life easier, and gives the best results. Therefore, they come personally recommended by me.

So here are some of the best **Tools for Blogging and Affiliate Marketing** that you can also use to save your time and can get an even better result.

My website is based on WordPress WordPress is the CMS (content management system) we are using to run this blog. 26% of the websites in the world are running on WordPress. 30% of the top 1000 websites in the world are using WordPress to run their blog.

It's very easy to manage and you can create a stunning blog with its themes and plugins. I started my first blog with WordPress and now almost 95% of blogs are running on WordPress **(few are on blogger.com).**

I would highly recommend you to use Wordpress.org as it is very easy to use and user-friendly. Even you can also create your own website by watching some tutorials on Youtube.

### WordPress Theme

This website is built using the **Divi Theme**. Divi makes building websites faster and more efficient. It will streamline your design process and improve team collaboration. It's also amazingly affordable. Build unlimited websites for your clients on a single membership.

### Hosting and Domain

This blog is running on **[A2hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/?aid=5e5418e79a344)**. **A2 Hosting** was all an idea of a certain **Bryan Muthig** who set the blueprint of a **Web Hosting Service** that has become one of the big dogs in terms of speed and reliability. Their turbo servers **guarantee 20x** quicker page loads compared to regular hosting platforms. Further, you can read the full **[review here](https://zblogging.com/a2-hosting-review/)**.

**\#3. Namecheap**: My 90% domain is on Godaddy. This is one of the top domain provider company and they provide you chat support 24×7.

### Keyword Research Tools

**[KWFinder](https://kwfinder.com/)** is a great keyword research tool with an awesome **UI. It is fast, reliable** and very easy to use. Read my review about KWFinder here.

WordPress is nothing without the plugins. Plugins make your blog powerful to make it more engaging and give you more flexibility to extend the features.

**\#1. Pretty Links** – This is one of the must-have plugins for any blog. If you are adding any kind of affiliate links on your blog, you need this plugin.

**\#2. Thrive Leads** – I have tried many lead capture plugins in the past but this is the plugin I love the most. This plugin allows you to add beautiful option boxes at various places with ease.

**\#4. WPCoupons** – I am using this plugin to create awesome looking coupons on my blog. You can create any coupon with this plugin and create a special coupon option at your blog to promote various affiliate products.

**\#5. Thrive Architect –** I am using this plugin to create stunning landing pages on my blog. This is by far the best plugin I have ever come across to create landing pages. My second choice is the Elementor.

**\#6.** **Ultimate Social –** This plugin helps me to add the beautiful looking share button on my blog. I can place the button before or after the content, or I can even create a floating share button on my blog.

**\#7. Rank Math –**  It is one of the **[best SEO Tool for Wordpress.](https://zblogging.com/free-seo-tools-for-wordpress/)** Rank Math is Totally Free and it is an amazing tool I also use this tool on my other websites. Even this free tool is better than Yoast SEO Premium.

Just go their official website and Download this Free SEO Tool or you can install it from the WordPress directory. Rank Math is the swiss army knife of **Free SEO Tools** for WordPress. It gives you complete control over your entire website’s on-page SEO.
