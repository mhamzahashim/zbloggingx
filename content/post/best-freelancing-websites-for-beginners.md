It is one of the best freelancing platforms and even I started my career with Fiverr. Fiverr was founded by Micha Kaufman and Shai Wininger, and was launched in February 2010.

The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that would provide a two-sided platform for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors.

After the website had been established a number of years, some began to question the services available on the site.
