Choosing the best domain name for your brand should be difficult. You write down some names in a list, you think about it for a while, choose one and register it. The main problem comes when your winning option is not available (something very frequent) and you have to repeat the process **(once or several times)** to find the final domain.

I'm running 8 websites and running over 15 plus websites including clients. I have bought a lot of good domain names. So I'm going to share the in-depth things to consider when choosing your ideal domain name in other words, how to actually go about choosing! Let’s change that today. Here are 20-plus essential tips on How to Choose a Domain Name for Your Brand.

## What is the domain?

I'm not going to mess you up with a technical explanation. I better understand that the domain is the address of your website. That is, what people type in the browser to get to your page. Like my website address is **zblogging.com**

## Why do I need my own domain name?

Yes, I already know that, depending on where you have the web, you may have a domain of the style:

> **webname.wordpress.com or webname.blogspot.com**

But having your own domain name is necessary if you want to show seriousness and professional appearance. And perhaps you are thinking about why to buy a domain if you are still testing the ground and you are still not very clear about what you want to do with your website. 

Well simply because the domains are very cheapand by the time you decide to take the step, someone has gone ahead of you and bought that domanin.  Now you have to rethink changing the name of your website again which is not so easy.

## What type of domain should I choose?

When choosing domain names you to have to think different options: use keywords of your niche, your name, your brand. Let's take a closer look at them. Like your domain name should be easy to remember and easy to pronounce.

### **Keyword-Based Domain**

For example, something of the style a: ***giftsfor___.com*, *elmejor___.com* or   *___baratos.com***

But let's face it, today it is very difficult to find a domain of this type that is free. And so the importance that the search engines give to this is less than what they gave it a few years ago. However, if your website is focused on a very niche market, it would be interesting to find something along these lines.

## **Your name**

Use your full name is a good idea if you are a **freelancer** and betting your brand person. Of course, as your name is something common, it is quite likely that it is already registered. And that is why, recently, in a geek mother attack, I registered a domain with the name of my son.

The main downside that I see using your name is that your project evolves and you want to start working with other partners, transfer it. But come on, if you are clear that your business and you go hand in hand, it is a very good option.

## **Brand name**

You can also use the name of a brand, as in the case of *blogsterapp.com.* The advantage of this type of domain is that, if you choose something that is catchy, it can be easier to remember.

Although you run the risk of complicating it a lot, that it does not transmit anything and that you have to invest more resources in positioning yourself.

## **Mix your Name or Brand with Keywords**

If you have a hard time deciding (or finding an available domain) a good idea is to try a combination of the above. If it turns out that your name is already registered, you can create the domain by adding a keyword.

For example, if I were to sell **athletic shoes**, I might have mastery of the style at ***hamzashoesstore.com*** Yes, I know it is a bit of a strange example because the domain is very long. But I hope you get an idea of ​​what I mean. And of course, following this line, you can also combine the name of a brand with keywords.

The main downside that I see to these types of domains is that something very long and difficult to remember can come out.

## What should you keep in mind to choose a good domain name?

Before choosing the name of your domain, it is important that you take into account a series of key aspects that it must have:

* Better if it is **short** and easy to remember.
* Always register the **.com** version and then, if you want, some other variant. If the .com version isn't available, drop the idea because it's the first extension we thought of and it could cause confusion.
* **No numbers, hyphens, tildes, and the letter ñ**.
* Try **not to put two consonants together** (for example *redde___.com* ) that make reading difficult.
* **Avoid using abbreviations**.
* Check the **spelling**.
* Make it **easy to pronounce**.
* Watch **that it does not contain a registered trademark**.

## Steps to follow when choosing the name of your domain

The first thing I want you to understand is that there is no perfect domain name. So focus on finding a domain that suits your project well.

1. Make a list of all the ideas you can think of. If you see you scatter, use a timer and write down, for example, all the ideas you can think of in 15 minutes.
2. Let the list sit for a few hours, or better wait the next day.
3. Check what you have (you can help yourself with the timer) to discard the ideas that you no longer like and that do not meet the requirements that I have mentioned.
4. Sort the list according to preference and start checking the availability of the domains.
5. If the domain is free, remember to check the availability of the main social networks.
6. When you find a domain that meets all the requirements, register it before they are advanced.
