Marketing of a website is natural you do some **[SEO](https://zblogging.com/what-is-seo)** you do some content marketing maybe some social media marketing and boom you are famous. But **what can you do if you have a mobile app?** How do you market it? Hey, everyone, today I’m going to share with you **How to Promote Your Mobile Application?**

The first thing if you have a mobile app great you can start marketing, and I will show you how. But if you don’t have a mobile app and you are thinking about creating one app then the first startup with [**Build Fire**.](https://buildfire.com)

Build a fire is a quick and easy way to build an app without being a developer, and they do not charge more than your budget. So now, hopefully, you have a mobile app.

## Step 1: Do Press News for your Mobile App

The first thing you want to do your app marketing is you need the high press. If you are too lazy and you don’t want to create a media on your own go check out [Preserve](http://prserve.com).

Chris Barrett found it**.** You pay him, and he will give a fantastic press for your mobile app. I highly recommend **prserve.com** because their services are incredible. If you don’t want to pay and want to create on your own go and check out who is covering apps in your space.

If you have a beauty app then alright go to check out other beauty bloggers and give him your app free before you launch it into the public. By giving them access early like oh my god **Hamza**, your app is fantastic. I like it very much and when they want it then set a pricing plan for everyone.

## STEP 2: Get Coverage in Blogsphere

What you want to do is get coverage in the **Blogosphere.** Now, this is just like to have a press like someone covering and saying, Oh! The Jarvis app is just launched; it could just be someone talking about marketing, so you have a marketing app they include you in their blog post. So what I do is I go to reach out all the blogger that has an article related to my app.

## STEP 3: Spend Money on Ads

The third thing you want to do and I hate to say this is spending money on advertising. You get a lot of traffic from **[Facebook Ads](http://facebook.com)** for your app installation. You can also go to other people out there who have apps and buy paid ads from them. You also have some games on your phone what you see when you are playing games **online**.

Every popular game is saying that oh this game is also a fantastic download today to play it. That’s a way you can get your app in there, and it is very cheap you can do this is the quantity and that will help you drive a lot of installation. You can also use **[Google AdWords](https://zblogging.com/increase-google-ad-words-quality-score/)** for Marketing your app.

**Help users promote your app.** Add an in-app "tell a friend" feature so that your current users can share the app with their friends, family, co-workers, and colleagues. Incentivize this sharing feature by offering credits or discounts for every new subscriber someone brings onboard.

For these three things, you can get a lot of app installation and you will popular hopefully your app monetize so that way you can make money once you have peoples in your app then you can start doing things like giving people points by sharing your app on social media or other sources which will be helpful in more installation and the long term but if you have no one coming to your app those viral loops will work.

So try these techniques and **get popular your mobile apps** and if you have any questions leave a comment below. I hope you liked this information so please don't forget to share this information because sharing this caring.
