One of the most asked questions I get is, “Hamza, how do I choose products to sell as an affiliate? “I don’t want to ruin my reputation selling things “that my audience won’t like.”

When it comes to affiliate marketing then the main question everybody asks is “How To Find the Perfect Affiliate Product”. The answer is very simple. Just follow my step by step guide.

Well, there’s a framework to find the **perfect affiliate product**, and if you follow it step by step, you’ll end up selling much more than if you just copy and paste an Amazon affiliate code on your website hoping that you’re going to generate sales.

So you’re probably wondering what it is, right? today, I’m going to show you **how to find the perfect affiliate product to sell** to your audience that they’ll love.

First, if you don’t know what your audience’s main problems are, what their needs, what their wants are, you need to start by surveying them and talking to them. Ask them questions like,

* **“What is the biggest challenge that you’re facing?**
* **“What are the most burning questions that you want to be answered?**
* **“What’s not out there, what product, service, or tool, would you like someone to create?**
* **“What level of expertise do you have?**
* **“Are you a beginner, intermediate, expert?**
* **“What’s your preferred method of learning?**
* **“Is it reading, listening, watching, practicing?**
* **“Do you pay for any subscriptions that can help you in your life, in your basketball journey, “in your musician lessons?” I don’t know, whatever category you’re in, but you get the point.**

Have you ever bought any products or services to improve your,” and let them fill in the blank? You can modify all of these questions for your audience. You can always install **live chat tools** or use tools like **Qualaroo or SurveyMonkey** to figure this out, or you could just ask open-ended questions.

By figuring out what your audience needs, what their problems are if they have paid for other products & services, ‘ll tell you what you can sell to them, and what you shouldn’t waste your time with.

For example, if you’re selling **musician-related products**, or your blog or your website’s about music, and you find out that everyone’s an expert, and you decide to sell beginner-related products, you’re not going to get many conversions.

But if you find out that everyone’s a beginner, and you **sell beginner-related products**, and then intermediate as people go up, and then expert products as they go up, even more, you’ll do much better.

That’s why it’s really important to figure out what your audience is all about, the issues and pain points they have. That way you know what to sell them from an **affiliate standpoint**, to generate the most income. 

## Brainstorm All Solutions

Second, you want to brainstorm all kinds of solutions, the **products, the services,** that can help your audience to find out. Create a blank document. Jot down any ideas that cross your mind, whether it is something that you’ve already seen, or no one’s invented yet.

There’s no filter. You can do whatever you want. You can even browse other **affiliate sites** to see what’s out there, and this will give you ideas as well.

## Find Products

Third, look for products that fall into any of these categories, and are top sellers in their categories. For example, if you go on **Amazon**, they clearly show you what are **top sellers** in a category. You can install **[Affilitizer’s Chrome extension.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/affilitizer/oiclkoiceoklnignlihmpciebcppgbcm?hl=en)**

It’ll tell you if there are any **affiliate programs** for products or services that you come across on the Web. It’ll even give you a direct link to **affiliate programs** so you can sign up.

Even when you’re browsing content, it’ll let you know if you’re looking at a piece of information related to an affiliate program out there. Now if you want to **sell retail**, search for products in any of the following programs.

**Amazon Associates**\
**eBay Partner Network,**\
**Jet.com Affiliates,**\
**Target Affiliates,**\
**Walmart Affiliate program.**

If you’re open to selling other kinds of products, like **educational-based, or even software**, check out these websites:

ClickBank\
JVZoo\
OfferVault\
Rakuten\
Warrior Plus\
FlexOffers\
ShareASale\
Commission Junction\
Avangate\
MaxBounty\
PeerFly

If you want to focus on **educational products**, check out

Udemy\
Treehouse\
Coursera\
QuickStart\
360training

Those sites should give you an idea of what could work, and what won’t work for you and your audience.

## Create a Strategy

The fourth thing you need to consider is whatever products or services you consider selling as affiliates, here are the criteria that they need to meet.

Because if they don’t meet these criteria, one, you won’t do well, but two, you’re going to look bad to your audience. So let’s go over the criteria. It needs to be directly connected to the content that you write about. So if you’re writing about music stuff, your offers, your products, services, need to be about music.

If you start offering something else, not only will you not make any money, but people are going to be pissed off at you. It also needs to help people out. This is a huge criterion for me.

If something doesn’t help out your audience, then why would you sell it to them. Sure, in the short run, you may **make some money,** but in the long run, you’re going to burn **your reader base,** you’re going to lose your trust, and you won’t do well in the long run.

**Warren Buffet always has this philosophy:**

> If you have a choice between something that can **make you money** in the short run or something that’s going to burn your brand, take the option of not making the money, and protect your brand.

**Why? Because it creates longevity.** So this is how I really figure out if this helps people out. I look at my audience, and be like, “All right, is this going to help them out **“in an educational way?**

“Is this going to solve a nagging problem that they’re facing in life?\
“Is this something that removes friction from something that they experience on a daily basis?\
“Is this something that speeds up a process in your audience’s life?\
“Is this something that makes things easier, cheaper, more effective, or even more elegant, right?\
“Is it something that raises your status among your peers, your family, your friends?”

If it meets a lot of those criteria, if it’s something that you would use yourself, if it’s something that you would easily recommend to your friend, then you have something that’s worth promoting.

## Proper Ad Placement

The fifth thing that you need to do is don’t **just put links** and ads all over your website to these products and services. They need to play an active role in your content. You’ve got to blend them in contextually. That way, as people are reading, they’re getting an education, they can also buy.

You need to teach people how they can accomplish their goals using these products and services. You need to put out tutorials, in-depth reviews, product comparisons. By doing those things, you’re much more likely **to get sales**.

And when you’re doing a product comparison, you can also sign up as an affiliate to the other product that you’re promoting. Sure, it may not perform as well as the main product that you’re focusing on, But, if someone decides to sign up for that other product that you don’t think is that great, eh, at least you’re going to get an affiliate commission from it.

And subtly mention these products and services within your content when there are other related topics. And of course, make sure you include a call to action. If you don’t have a call to action when you’re **promoting affiliate offers,** you’re not going to do well.
