Affiliate marketing is becoming more and more popular, but it can be a difficult topic to understand. If youâ€™re having trouble picking up what this type of content entails or how affiliate marketing works in general, then read on.

The digital media industry has seen an increase in revenue from affiliate marketing over the years, which makes sense because people are always looking for new ways to make money online these days. Affiliates promote products they want their audience to buy by embedding links within blog posts. 

Affiliate Marketing is a marketing method where other companies' affiliate markets products and services using one's third-party website. In return for every visitor referred to the seller's site, the affiliate receives payment from the seller. Affiliate marketing programs are easy to get into due to their low start-up costs and simple structure.

However, not all affiliate programs provide high-income potentials, and some affiliates find themselves earning very little. In fact, according to Statistica, web hosting revenue worldwide in 2015 was at $17 billion, with nearly 60 million domains hosted worldwide (Statista). 

Combining "easy" entry-level requirements combined with various amounts of money that can be made through this online business model has made affiliate marketing a popular choice for many people looking to start their own online business. People who are knowledgeable about blogging, making websites, and the internet, in general, can earn decent money by referring others to different products and services. 

Another benefit of affiliate marketing is the compensation that it provides for its affiliates, and this article will be covering the commissions paid out by some of the top-performing affiliate networks. 

Even though numerous factors make up a company's commission structure, commissions play an important factor because it is one portion of an affiliate's most visible income within their bank account reports.

## What is affiliate marketing and how does it work?

Affiliate marketing is when you promote other people's or companies' products or services using your own site. In return, the affiliate receives a commission from every sale generated based on their efforts. 

So, for example, if you have a website and you want to make money promoting other people's products such as health supplements or outdoor equipment, you can put an advertisement about one of those companies on your website. When someone clicks on that link and then makes a purchase at the end of their shopping session with that company, you will earn a commission determined by the terms set by the affiliate network.

Depending on which network you are working with (i.e., Commission Junction), commissions range between 5% and 75% per sale depending on the product's product and how much it costs. The product's price and the amount of commission you'll be making will vary between products. 

For example, Commission Junction pays out a $10 commission for any product sold above $20. This is why affiliate marketing programs are profitable to join because many of them pay commissions on media such as downloads, phone calls, leads, or sales, depending on what the program is offering. 

So if someone buys a weight loss product that costs $30, you would make a total commission of $40 ($10 from the first tier commission and another $10 from the second tier commission). The process goes like this:

* Step 1: Person A clicks on your affiliate link Step.
* Step 2: Person A receives their own unique tracking ID number Step 
* Step 3: Person A makes a purchase with the company Step 
* Step 4: Person A confirms their purchase via your affiliate link To ensure that you receive 100% commission, you need to make sure that each step in the process is completed. 

For example, if person A did not click on your affiliate link but instead found out about the product and ordered it from other sources, there would only be a 50% commission rate.
