When we perform a search, for example, in Google, we see a list of different results. Usually, we look at the first results. And if we want our business to appear in a good position, how do we get it? The answer is SEO. But the question is, **What is Search Engine Optimization?**

It is the process of improving the visibility of a website, positioning it in the main search engines, understood how to google, yahoo, etc. SEO is a type of organic positioning; since it is not paid to appear in the best positions, it is achieved through tricks, strategies, and functional development of the site.

SEO has a branding value since users associate the excellent positioning of the website with the prestige of the brand. Being in a better place generates a more significant number of visits.

## What factors does SEO take into account?

SEO merges two elements. On the one hand, it considers **how search engines work,** and on the other, **how users search**. It is imperative to optimize the website to facilitate the information contained on our website so that the search engines position us correctly. Therefore, investigate how users search our products or services in search engines is essential to obtain good results.

## How do search engines work?

To carry out a successful strategy, you need to know how search engines work. First, always keep in mind that search engines meet the information needs of users. The results are updated regularly using algorithms, which means that the positions can change.

### Relevancy

The web pages that tell you how to make chocolate chip cookies may not be closely related to the message you’re trying to convey regarding that recipe. That’s why Google looks first for closely related web pages to your keyword. 

The most relevant pages may not merely appear at the top of Google’s search results because there are many thousands (or even millions) of relevant pages for each search term.

For example, the keyword **“cookie recipes” brings up 349 million results in Google**.

## What are the Benefits of SEO?

SEO offers different benefits and utilities. It is essential to understand that not all businesses use this tool with the same objective, and therefore the strategies will not be the same; there is no strict guideline to follow. Every business has a **different SEO strategy**.

We must generate searches for the product or service that we offer. For example, if we have a very novel product, and therefore, nonexistent for our possible target audience, they will not be made. That is why we need to carry out marketing actions in advance to know.

Therefore, we must avoid using the SEO tool as an independent strategy. That is, it must be integrated into our marketing plan. Achieving total cohesion of all our actions will ensure that we make the objectives set.
