## SEO Terminologies Starting with A

**AMP:** AMP is an online publishing format developed by Google as a competitor to Facebook’s Instant Articles. It is similar to HTML and is optimized for mobile web browsing. Using unique code, AMP-HTML is intended to help webpages load rapidly when clicked in the Google search results pages, though results have varied.

**Algorithm:** An algorithm (**pronounced AL-go-rith-um**) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. 

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem. It determines the rules that define the positioning of a page within the search results. There are a lot of Algorithms in Google’s.

**Algorithm Change:** Algorithmic changes are often unnoticed, but the impact of a major algorithmic change can usually be seen quite quickly. Though it sometimes takes weeks for an algorithm to completely roll out across all platforms 

A lot of people don't realize that algorithms exist in almost every facet our lives and we're constantly being influenced by them without even realizing it.  There's so much more research needed on these silent power influencers because they might have some unintended consequences we haven't considered yet. Algorithmic changes come in three forms:

* **Algorithm Update:** The search engine is constantly changing the signals of its algorithm in order to provide a more customized experience.
* **Algorithm Refresh:** The search engine re-runs an existing algorithm using the exact same signals as last time.
* **New Algorithm:** The search engine is always looking for a way to improve the quality of their searches. Google has developed many new algorithms including Panda and Penguin, among others.

**Anchor text:** *Anchor text* is the clickable *text* in a hyperlink. SEO best practices dictate that *anchor text* is relevant to the page you’re linking to, rather than generic version. The blue, underlined *anchor text* is the most common as it is the web standard, although it is possible to change the color and underlining through HTML code.

**Alt attribute:** The alt attribute is the HTML attribute used in HTML and XHTML documents to specify alternative text that is to be rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered. Also known as: **Alt Text.**

**Above the Fold:** The Page Layout Algorithm is an algorithm developed by Google in 2012 to penalize websites that feature too many ads. The idea behind the design was for users who scroll down a website, they should not be bombarded with numerous advertisements in succession.

**AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a type of programming that allows you to create dynamic webpages without having to reload. This means your webpage will change depending on the information sent from a server, which makes it more engaging for visitors.

**Analytics:** The more you know about data, the better you will be at making decisions. Data is a tool that we can use to make educated guesses and predictions in order to take action for our future success.

**Also see: [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Computer science refers to the technique of programming computers to perform tasks that require human intelligence. An AI computer system functions like a digital brain that learns instead of following a set of programmed rules (like an algorithm). AI is also capable of making and implementing decisions without human intervention.

**Authority:** The importance of a website to the search engine is not measured by keywords alone. Search engines look at other signals, such as how long you spend on it and whether or not others link back to your site for determining rankings.

## SEO Terminologies Starting with B

**B2B:** Business-to-Business is a long process that involves more expensive products, and professional decision makers. You will need to be friendly with them during the buying cycle if you want your company to stand out from all of their other competitors.

**B2C:** In B2C SEO, the buying cycle is typically shorter (though it still varies by industry), products and services are cheaper ($$$) than they are for business-to-business dealings. And consumers should be your audience.

**Backlinks:** A backlink for a given web resource is a link from some other website to that web resource. A web resource may be a website, web page, or web directory. A backlink is a reference comparable to a citation.

**Baidu:** Baidu, Inc. is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products and artificial intelligence, headquartered in Beijing's Haidian District. It is one of the largest AI and Internet companies in the world.

**Bing:** Microsoft Bing is a web search engine owned and operated by the company. The service is based on Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. The company offers a variety of search products, including web, video, image, and map search.

**Black Box:** The man sits in front of a complex computer program, one that is poorly understood. The inputs and outputs can be observed but there's no access to the process itself due to its confidential nature; he doesn't know how it works or what will happen if he changes something.

For example, **Google’s algorithm** is a black box.

**Black Hat SEO:** Black Hat SEO is the process of manipulating search engine results to rank a website higher than its competitors. It’s an unethical practice that can potentially lead to disastrous consequences for businesses if they don't take precautions against it. Black hat SEO consists of techniques designed with one goal: Google PageRank manipulation so your site ranks at or near the top spot in SERPS (search engine result pages). 

**Blog:** In a publication, all the recent content will appear at the top of the list, sorted by date. Written by an individual or a group of contributors, the content reflects a person's or company's interests. Originally, blogs were called web logs or weblogs. The term was confusing due to the fact that "web log" can also refer to log files on a server. In order to avoid this confusion, the abbreviation "blog" was coined and became the standard term.

**Bounce Rate:** Bounce rate is the percentage of people who view one page on your website and then leave without going to other pages. It's a statistic that can tell you if visitors are getting what they need from your site in just a single visit, or if potential customers might be confused about where to find certain information. 

A high bounce rate may indicate an issue with either design or content quality while low rates could mean visitors have found everything they were looking for upfront; it all depends on how well you set up expectations before showing them anything else.

**Bot:** An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could.

**Breadcrumbs:** Breadcrumbs are used by search engines to keep track of pages, so that they can rank the most relevant ones first and show them in order. Breadcrumbs allow people to retrace their steps through a website easily while also helping webmasters create navigational menus without having to worry about designing or coding any additional elements on each page for navigation purposes.

Bread crumbs serve as markers for webpages when being indexed by Google's spiders; this allows us not only be able find where we've been but get back there with ease if need be as well.

**Broken Link:** A broken backlink is an incoming link pointing to an “[error 404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)“ page of a target website. In the same way you can find your competitors’ broken pages that have a lot of backlinks and use it for your broken link building strategy.

A link that leads to a 404 not found. Typically, a link becomes broken when:

* A website goes offline.
* A webpage is removed without implementing a redirect.
* The destination URL is changed without implementing a redirect.

**Blogging:** Blogging is the fastest growing form of media. It provides a space to share your own thoughts and insights, while also being able to learn from other likeminded individuals.

In today's world of social networking and online publishing, blogging has become one way for companies or organizations with limited budgets an opportunity to market themselves on-line in order reach their target audience cheaply without professional assistance - it can be as simple as posting essays about what you love best.

## SEO Terminologies Starting with C

**Cached Page:** A cached page is a web page that has been saved by an internet user on their browser or search engine in order to allow the person access even when they are not connected. Search engines cache pages as well so people can still get them, no matter if there is something wrong with the website's server and it cannot be accessed at all.

**CDN:** Content Delivery Network; a network of connected servers that allow faster transmission of content to users located in geographic areas far from the data center.

**Canonical URL:** A canonical link element is an HTML element that helps webmasters prevent duplicate content issues in search engine optimization by specifying the “canonical” or “preferred” version of a web page. 

**ccTLD:** A company based in the Pakistan would have a domain like this: www.example.co.pk, where they use ccTLDs to represent their country of origin

A country-code top-level domain is required for any companies located outside the country who want to provide content or services on the Internet and it stands as an indicator that these are local sites with staff from either within just one particular region or many more than one other countries.

**Click Bait:** Clickbait is a text or thumbnail link that attracts attention, enticing users to follow the given link and read what it has. The headlined content of these links are typically sensationalized and misleading for readers as they may not provide them with accurate information about its contents.

**Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Click-through rate is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.

**CMS:** A Content Management System is a system that manages the content on websites. You may have heard of platforms like WordPress, Joomla! or Drupal? These are all CMSs and this type of software gives us the ability to create any kind of website we want with relative ease.

**Cloaking:** Cloaking is a search engine optimization technique in which the content presented to the spider and user are different. The websites present their most relevant information for ranking purposes, but when someone clicks on it they receive some other version of what was seen by Googlebot or another automated crawler.

Cloaking is an SEO tactic that involves presenting two versions of your site - one optimized for spiders and bots (i.e., robots) like Google's webcrawlers with text-based navigation links as well as images, videos etc.; while others will show up more humanized representations without these elements so viewers can easily read through articles at their own speed.

A **"Content Management System" (CMS)** is what allows you to do things such as edit your own site when it comes time for updating information, upload media files like images in order to make attractive posts, add blog entries about anything.

**Co-Citation:** Co-citation, similar to Bibliographic Coupling, measures semantic similarity of documents based on citations. The co-citation of two documents is defined as their frequent citation by other documents.

For instance, imagine Search Engine Journal and Search Engine Roundtable never linked to or mentioned each other. However, other websites and blogs would likely mention both SEJ and SER on lists of popular search engine news publications.

**To see this in action, see: related:https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ search engine journal**

**Spam Comments:** Comment spam is a term referencing a broad category of spambot or spammer postings which abuse web-based forms to post unsolicited advertisements as comments on forums, blogs, wikis and online guestbooks.

**Competition:** 

There are two types of competition:

* **Direct Competitors:** One of the most important aspects for any company is to be proactive in marketing their product. A good way to do this is by targeting customers that have similar needs and wants as you, whether they're online or offline.
* **SEO Competitors:** Companies that are competing in the same market might have different products or services, but they're all trying to attract and retain customers. The way this company measures success is by utilizing their expert SEO skills as well as engaging with potential consumers on a personal level.

**Content:** The communication of information by means of words, images, videos, or sounds (or any combination thereof). The second most important ranking factor for Google (along with links). Content that is useful, informative, valuable, credible, unique, and engaging will be rewarded by search engines with better traffic and visibility.

**Content is King:** It is often used by conference speakers and authors of SEO (and digital marketing) publications. According to this definition, "content is king" usually means that your business, online presence, or SEO success is dependent on your content.

* Downloading premium content (e.g., ebook, whitepaper).
* Subscribing to an email newsletter.
* Video views.

**Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate is calculated by dividing the number of conversions by the number of visitors.

**Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):** Increasing the percentage of users who take a desired action on a website is known as conversion rate optimization (CRO). An action can include purchasing a product, adding it to the cart, signing up for a service, filling out a form, or clicking a link.

**Correlation:** It is the extent of a connection between two or more elements. Because algorithms are black boxes, they are often used in SEO research to infer relationships between variables. Keep in mind, however, that correlation **≠** causation.

**Crawl Budget:** The crawl budget is the number of pages Google will crawl on your site every day. There are some minor variations throughout the day, but overall, it is fairly stable. Your website might receive 6 crawls per day from Google, it might receive 5,000 crawls per day, even 4,000,000 crawls per day.

### SSL Certificate:
