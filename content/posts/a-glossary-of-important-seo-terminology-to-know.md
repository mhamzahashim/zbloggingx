## SEO Terminologies Starting with A

**AMP:** AMP is an online publishing format developed by Google as a competitor to Facebook’s Instant Articles. It is similar to HTML and is optimized for mobile web browsing. Using unique code, AMP-HTML is intended to help webpages load rapidly when clicked in the Google search results pages, though results have varied.

**Algorithm:** An algorithm (**pronounced AL-go-rith-um**) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. 

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem. It determines the rules that define the positioning of a page within the search results. There are a lot of Algorithms in Google’s.

**Algorithm Change:** Algorithmic changes are often unnoticed, but the impact of a major algorithmic change can usually be seen quite quickly. Though it sometimes takes weeks for an algorithm to completely roll out across all platforms 

A lot of people don't realize that algorithms exist in almost every facet our lives and we're constantly being influenced by them without even realizing it.  There's so much more research needed on these silent power influencers because they might have some unintended consequences we haven't considered yet. Algorithmic changes come in three forms:

* **Algorithm Update:** The search engine is constantly changing the signals of its algorithm in order to provide a more customized experience.
* **Algorithm Refresh:** The search engine re-runs an existing algorithm using the exact same signals as last time.
* **New Algorithm:** The search engine adds a new algorithm to improve search quality. For example: Google Panda, Google Penguin.

**Anchor text:** *Anchor text* is the clickable *text* in a hyperlink. SEO best practices dictate that *anchor text* is relevant to the page you’re linking to, rather than generic version. The blue, underlined *anchor text* is the most common as it is the web standard, although it is possible to change the color and underlining through HTML code.

**Alt attribute:** The alt attribute is the HTML attribute used in HTML and XHTML documents to specify alternative text that is to be rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered.

**Above the Fold:** The Page Layout Algorithm is an algorithm developed by Google in 2012 to penalize websites that feature too many ads. The idea behind the design was for users who scroll down a website, they should not be bombarded with numerous advertisements in succession.

**AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a type of programming that allows you to create dynamic webpages without having to reload. This means your webpage will change depending on the information sent from a server, which makes it more engaging for visitors.



### Backlinks:

A backlink for a given web resource is a link from some other website to that web resource. A web resource may be a website, web page, or web directory. A backlink is a reference comparable to a citation. 

### Broken Link:

A broken backlink is an incoming link pointing to an “[error 404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)“ page of a target website. In the same way you can find your competitors’ broken pages that have a lot of backlinks and use it for your broken link building strategy.

### **CDN:**

Content Delivery Network; a network of connected servers that allow faster transmission of content to users located in geographic areas far from the data center.

### SSL Certificate:

SSL. Stands for “Secure Sockets Layer.” SSL is a secure protocol developed for sending information securely over the Internet. Many websites use SSL for secure areas of their sites, such as user account pages and online checkout. Usually, when you are asked to “log in” on a website, the resulting page is secured by SSL.

### CMS:

Content Management System; is a program that allows you to create websites without particular coding or programming knowledge. WordPress is a CMS and in my opinion, it is the best.

### Structured Data:

Structured data is coded using in-page markup on the page that the information applies to. The structured data on the page should describe the content of that page. 

You should not create blank or empty pages just to hold structured data; nor should you add structured data about information that is not visible to the user, even if the information is accurate. For more technical and quality guidelines, see the [Structured data general guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies).

### Dofollow Backlink:

Dofollow backlinks allow Google or whatever search engine is being used, to follow them and reach your website. Basically, these are links that will pass on the SEO benefits of the website where it is built from the hyperlinked website. This will improve its ranking position significantly in search engines.

### Nofollow Backlink:

What is a nofollow backlink? Nofollow backlink does not pass the authority because the tag rel=” nofollow” in the HTML code of the website tells crawlers not to follow these backlinks. Google does not transfer the authority or anchor text across nofollow links.

### Error 404:

The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, Page Not Found, or Server Not Found error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.
