## Best Freelance Websites for Beginners:

Below is a list of some of the best freelancing websites every beginner can use to start freelancing and earn money.

**Fiverr:**

It is one of the best freelancing platforms and even I started my career from Fiverr. Fiverr was founded by **Micha Kaufman** and Shai Wininger, and was launched in February 2010.

The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that would provide a two-sided platform for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors. Services offered on the site include writing, translation, graphic design, video editing, and programming and much more.

Fiverr’s services start at US$5 and can go up to thousands of dollars with Gig Extras. Each service offered is called a “**Gig**”. It is the Best Freelancing Website for Beginners.

**eLance or Upwork:**

Elance was founded in 1999 by Beerud Sheth, Srini Anumolu, and Sanjay Noronha. oDesk was founded in 2003 by Odysseas Tsatalos and Stratis Karamanlakis. Upwork was formed 18 months after and oDesk announced their merger on December 18, 2013, to create Elance-oDesk.

With the launch of Upwork, the oDesk platform was upgraded and rebranded and the company announced that the Elance platform would be phased out within a couple of years, resulting in a single freelance marketplace. Fiverr and Upwork are the Best Freelancing Websites for Beginners.

Be honest I’m working on these two sites only. Becuase they both are **enough for an indivual freelancer.** If you have an agency then you can create your profile on other platforms.

**PeoplePerHour**:

The good thing about PPH is that you can earn per hour. The minimum rate of this platform is $10. Like you can start from $10 per hour.

PPH Founded in 2007 by Xenios Thrasyvoulou and Simos Kitiris. Businesses opting to use the website are often start-ups or **SMEs** looking to grow flexibly by hiring freelancers to handle projects rather than hiring in-house or via agencies.

Jobs start from little as an hour (“**Offers**”) and can be ramped up as needed to build whole teams online, meaning the model is scalable all the way up to global enterprises.

As the leading marketplace for freelance talent in the UK, PeoplePerHour holds a powerful insight into the self-employed segment of the labor market and have created and collaborated on numerous research projects on SMEs, freelancing, and the gig economy and provide resources for new and growing businesses and those looking to pursue a freelance career.

**99Designs**:

This freelancing platform is popular for the flexibility and global reach it provides to professionals. If you are a graphics designer with great skills, the platform is a great place for you to try it out.

With a huge customer base, 99Designs can help you find a project as the system is backed by a significant business community that thrives on growth. This freelancing platform is best especially for graphics designers only.

**LinkedIn**:

You would be surprised how often people post about freelance job positions they need to be filled on LinkedIn. There are often opportunities posted on the LinkedIn job board, but you should also check the search bar to see if anyone is looking for your services.

One downside of LinkedIn is that since so many people are on the site, you’re likely to have some competition when applying for jobs. Therefore, it is important to apply across a range of platforms and find which ones work best for you.

**Fivesquid**:

In 2011, Fivesquid was launched as a start-up company to watch because Theo Paphitis highlighted the company as part of his Small Business Sunday competition.

As of 2011, people have been selling a host of services through the website, including the former UK version of The X Factor contestant Kitty Brucknell, who offered to send you a voicemail for £5.

**Guru**:

Guru Inc. was founded in 1999 in San Francisco as an online clearinghouse for high tech workers seeking short-term contracts. The company, led by brothers Jon and James Slavet, raised $3M in angel funding and a further $16M in a full venture round led by Greylock Partners and August Capita In a May 2000 interview,

Paul Saffo cited **Guru.com** as an example of a company using the Internet to provide new kinds of services where individuals negotiated directly with potential employers.

The company was acquired in December 2002 by Unicru, a human resources software company based in Portland, Oregon. Guru’s technology and staff remained with Unicru. It is the best jobs website for Wordpress developers. You can sell designing and developing services on this platform.

This platform lets users get paid not only by the hour or the task, but also based on milestones and recurring payments.

**Legiit**:

It is a community-driven top freelance marketplace. It is a small growing freelance site where you can start right now because they also have a community on Facebook with over 50K+ members where you can share the link of your services to promote them for free.

**Freelancer**:

Freelancer is a marketplace where freelancers and employees may find each other. They can post opportunities for work that bidders can bid on the project. Members can also host contests through the site where money can be awarded as a prize.

Individual freelancers and employers can submit profiles to the site in response to work offered, won, and completed and the reviews they receive from people they work with or for.

The site’s members receive a limited number of bids, which are periodically replaced. A range of paid accounts are available, ranging from free to professional.
