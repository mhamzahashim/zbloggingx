These freelance job websites are great places for those who want to try their hand at making some money on the side or even as main sources of income. Depending on your area of expertise and skills, you can choose your favorite freelance job website from the list below.

## Best Freelance Websites for Beginners:

### **Fiverr:**

Fiverr has become a household name among just about anyone and everyone. What started as a simple website where freelance workers could offer five dollars has turned into a billion-dollar company since its creation in 2010. 

Fiverr has different "gigs" that you can choose to sell, such as logo design, voice-over talent, e-book writing, or even creating content for an SEO campaign. You can also use the site to find work if you don't have any gigs filled on your profile yet, and make sure that you include some of your samples such as logos, audio clips, and more, so potential buyers know what you're capable of. 

The gig marketplace offers millions of buyers at all times, which means that there are more than enough opportunities to be had. It is one of the best freelancing platforms and even I started my career from Fiverr. Fiverr was founded by **Micha Kaufman** and Shai Wininger, and was launched in February 2010.

The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that would provide a two-sided platform for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors. Services offered on the site include writing, translation, graphic design, video editing, and programming and much more.

Fiverr’s services start at US$5 and can go up to thousands of dollars with Gig Extras. Each service offered is called a “**Gig**”. It is the best freelancing website for beginners.

### **eLance or Upwork:**

Upwork has been around for years and is still one of the most popular freelance websites for beginners. Upwork brings freelancers of all types together with millions of clients (over 12 million to be exact). The company aims to help people find jobs that suit their skill set and the amount they charge based on per hour, per project, or word. 

So if you're looking to find some work fast, then this site might be the one for you as many companies are always posting jobs and have thousands of users waiting to get hired. So if you're having trouble finding gigs in other places, check out Upwork, where there's bound to be something available at any time.

Upwork also offers a job board where people can post openings for freelancers to find work fast. From here, you can reach out to potential employers, conduct interviews via Skype or other instant messaging services, and get hired on the spot through their interface. 

In addition, you'll have access to all of your important documents in one easy location, such as contracts, invoices, and even time tracking, so everything stays organized. Suppose you're not able to apply directly from a job posting. In that case, you can submit applications with related skills listed on your profile, so your chances are increased when applications are reviewed by hiring managers.

Upwork is probably one of the easiest ways that beginners and experts alike can find jobs online at any time. With millions of users using this website, it's hard not to find something that interests you or even a client who might have the same skills that you do. The platform is designed to help both parties, and I should know as this site has helped me with various projects in the past.

Elance was founded in 1999 by Beerud Sheth, Srini Anumolu, and Sanjay Noronha. oDesk was founded in 2003 by Odysseas Tsatalos and Stratis Karamanlakis. Upwork was formed 18 months after and oDesk announced their merger on December 18, 2013, to create Elance-oDesk.

With the launch of Upwork, the oDesk platform was upgraded and rebranded and the company announced that the Elance platform would be phased out within a couple of years, resulting in a single freelance marketplace. Fiverr and Upwork are the Best Freelancing Websites for Beginners.

Be honest I’m working on these two sites only. Becuase they both are **enough for an indivual freelancer.** If you have an agency then you can create your profile on other platforms.

### **PeoplePerHour**:

PeoplePerHour is another option if you're looking to earn money with freelance work online. You'll be able to post your profile and connect with potential employers who will respond if they want your services for any given task or job posting listed on the site. 

PeoplePerHour has a wide range of categories from programming and testing, web development, marketing, and social media work, writing jobs, and more, so there's plenty of opportunities to find something that's in line with what you do best.

You may not always get paid as much as at other sites, but it can still be an ideal place for those who are just starting with freelancing or might also want to work on side projects while keeping their day-to-day jobs. Many people have posted jobs on this site and earned at least some cash in return for their time.

It means that you should be able to find plenty of jobs that are suitable for you here if you're looking to make money with freelance platforms or any other methods listed above. The good thing about PPH is that you can earn per hour. The minimum rate of this platform is $10. Like you can start from $10 per hour.

PPH Founded in 2007 by Xenios Thrasyvoulou and Simos Kitiris. Businesses opting to use the website are often start-ups or **SMEs** looking to grow flexibly by hiring freelancers to handle projects rather than hiring in-house or via agencies.

Jobs start from little as an hour (“**Offers**”) and can be ramped up as needed to build whole teams online, meaning the model is scalable all the way up to global enterprises.

As the leading marketplace for freelance talent in the UK, PeoplePerHour holds a powerful insight into the self-employed segment of the labor market and have created and collaborated on numerous research projects on SMEs, freelancing, and the gig economy and provide resources for new and growing businesses and those looking to pursue a freelance career.

### **99Designs**:

99Designs is another great when it comes to finding freelance work online. If you're a designer and know how to create custom graphics, logos, brand identity systems, websites, or other creative designs, this is the place. It's another large site that's been around for many years now, so it has thousands of potential employers looking for designers at any given time.

99Designs gives you the option of creating your profile completely free. Still, there's also a premium membership that gives you more features when posting jobs, including higher visibility on the site to be viewed by more clients and the ability to pay less commission, if any at all. Most companies will pay between $100 – $500+ per design they're looking to have created, so there is plenty of opportunities to make money with this site.

You'll be able to post jobs, sign up for extra opportunities such as judging contests and competitions, or becoming an affiliate. You can also submit your portfolio so potential employers can view all of the work you've done in the past. 

With a huge customer base, 99Designs can help you find a project as the system is backed by a significant business community that thrives on growth. This freelancing platform is best especially for graphics designers only.

### **LinkedIn**:

You would be surprised how often people post about freelance job positions they need to be filled on LinkedIn. There are often opportunities posted on the LinkedIn job board, but you should also check the search bar to see if anyone is looking for your services.

One downside of LinkedIn is that since so many people are on the site, you’re likely to have some competition when applying for jobs. Therefore, it is important to apply across a range of platforms and find which ones work best for you.

### **Fivesquid**:

In 2011, Fivesquid was launched as a start-up company to watch because Theo Paphitis highlighted the company as part of his Small Business Sunday competition.

As of 2011, people have been selling a host of services through the website, including the former UK version of The X Factor contestant Kitty Brucknell, who offered to send you a voicemail for £5.

### **Guru**:

Guru Inc. was founded in 1999 in San Francisco as an online clearinghouse for high tech workers seeking short-term contracts. The company, led by brothers Jon and James Slavet, raised $3M in angel funding and a further $16M in a full venture round led by Greylock Partners and August Capita In a May 2000 interview,

Paul Saffo cited **Guru.com** as an example of a company using the Internet to provide new kinds of services where individuals negotiated directly with potential employers.

The company was acquired in December 2002 by Unicru, a human resources software company based in Portland, Oregon. Guru’s technology and staff remained with Unicru. It is the best jobs website for Wordpress developers. You can sell designing and developing services on this platform.

This platform lets users get paid not only by the hour or the task, but also based on milestones and recurring payments.

### **Legiit**:

It is a community-driven top freelance marketplace. It is a small growing freelance site where you can start right now because they also have a community on Facebook with over 50K+ members where you can share the link of your services to promote them for free.

### **Freelancer**:

Freelancer is another large freelancing platform where people like you and myself can find jobs online. It's been around for years and has helped millions of people make money in their free time working on various projects from web design to video editing, graphics designing, writing, programming, and more. 

Freelancer allows you to create a portfolio page to show off your work which helps clients see your style when they browse through the available freelancers who can complete tasks that interest them most. In addition, you'll have access to an abundance of open jobs posted by employers looking for assistance with certain projects.

You'll also be able to receive notifications each time new jobs are posted, which makes it easy to keep up with job postings at all times without having to check back frequently. Freelancer is another great option if you're starting, but it's also a great place for experts to find high-paying projects that they can complete in their free time.

Freelancer is an ideal platform for anyone who wants to get started with freelance work online and is one of the best places to start. It is a marketplace where freelancers and employees may find each other. They can post opportunities for work that bidders can bid on the project. Members can also host contests through the site where money can be awarded as a prize.

Individual freelancers and employers can submit profiles to the site in response to work offered, won, and completed and the reviews they receive from people they work with or for. The site’s members receive a limited number of bids, which are periodically replaced. A range of paid accounts are available, ranging from free to professional.

### **Workana**:

Hire top freelancers: developers, web designers, writers, and all kinds of experts, and find freelance jobs on Workana, the leading freelance marketplace. The best place to find and hire expert freelancers.

You can build a freelance career from where you stand and reach out to hundreds of clients! Make a living out of your passion, managing your own time and workplace.

### **Toptal**:

TopTal is another awesome freelancing website for experienced and inexperienced workers alike. This site has been around since 2013, but it's still a great place to find gigs that pay big bucks, and if you're good at what you do, you can score some high-paying projects. TopTal has thousands of users waiting to be hired, whether they're experts or not, so if you want to try your hand at this freelancing thing, then head over there now. 

Just don't expect to make much initially as the platform requires some years of experience before top performers are considered and given access to their exclusive jobs page where companies hang out who need specific skills.
Toptal is also an option for just starting with freelance work and doesn't have much of a portfolio to show just yet. Rather than building up an entire portfolio before getting hired, 

TopTal allows users to bid on projects to show off their skills. You'll get paid for completing tasks; however, you won't make as much as those who already have proven themselves in the past, but it's a great way to start earning money doing what you enjoy without that much work at all.

Toptal also utilizes a feedback system where clients and freelancers leave comments about each other after completing tasks together. This helps the platform learn about how users feel about working with certain individuals or companies, giving TopTal an idea of whether or not those people should be paired together again.

Working on this site is ideal for beginners as it allows them to build up a portfolio and earn money from their skills while still trying to find themselves in the business. It's one of the best sites I've used over the years, and I make sure to refer anyone who needs to get started with freelance work here. 

You'll have access to all sorts of jobs that you can apply for, and if you do a good job for your clients, they'll automatically leave feedback about how well you did which will help you move up in rank so other companies can see what kind of work you do and whether or not they need it done as well.

If you are an experienced designer, software engineer, or finance specialist who excels in your field and is fluent in the English language, then Toptal is the freelance platform for you.  This service helps freelancers connect with companies seeking top talent. Whether you need a part-time or full-time job, Toptal can get it for you. It is excellent if you have skills accustomed to working in critical jobs.

### Behance

Behance is a top platform for those who are looking to find freelance work online. It's a great place to post your portfolio so employers and clients can see what you have to offer. In addition, you'll be able to create a profile that includes links to past projects, descriptions of your skills, blog posts, presentations, and more.

Behance gives you the option of posting paid or unpaid work, but it's geared towards companies that want to pay money for services they need to be completed. Most of the postings on this site come with budgets ranging from $1 – $5,000+ so if you do well, there is potential for big profits in freelancing on Behance.

One benefit of working here is that large companies will often hire you to help bring their company brand and online presence up to par. This means that, besides creating a profile on the site and finding jobs you want to work on, you'll also be working with the companies directly themselves, which can mean more money in your pocket as well.

Working at Behance is ideal for anyone who has worked for other employers before, either through an official job posting or a client approaching them about designing their website. It's one of the best sites I've used over the years as it has numerous companies looking for professionals to complete projects, so there's plenty of chances to earn some extra cash each month if you're willing to put in the time required.

### Amazon mTurk

mTurk may not be talked about much, but it's one of the better sites out there with a wide range of job postings that include all kinds of tasks such as surveys, data mining, transcription, tagging items in images, video transcription, and more. 

Like most sites I've listed above, you'll be able to post your profile and start searching for jobs. If you find a job within your area of expertise or a task that you have experience with, you can apply to it directly and get started.

"Micro-tasking" is the term used when it comes to completing tasks online like those listed above, so while some sites might pay more than others, mTurk pays fairly well compared to other micro-job sites available today. 

Many people who use this site make at least $100 per month, if not more, depending on how much time they commit towards each task posted, so there are plenty of opportunities to earn cash here if you're looking for a good side hustle ideas. 

### Brybe

Bribe is another online platform that can help you make money with freelance opportunities in just any area. Whether you're an expert video editor who knows how to create the most entertaining videos on YouTube or if you have content creation skills, including writing and blogging, then this is the place for you. 

They call themselves "The Future of Digital Work," and many people have found success using their platform to find work-from-home jobs like those listed above. You'll be able to sign up for a free account that allows you to post your profile, view other profiles within site, and apply directly for available projects where employers are looking for your assistance with various tasks online.  

What I like most about Brybe because there are so many different options available when it comes to finding work from home jobs. Many people find success with this platform, and thousands have found work in the past few years online using Brybe as a source for making money while working from home. 

It's one of the best places I've listed here if you're looking for freelance opportunities because not only will employers approach you first, but you can also post your profile which will allow them to seek out your expertise with various projects on the site. 

You'll be able to earn cash quickly depending on what type of skills you have or what kind of job opportunities you decide to pursue, so don't just think about it anymore and give it a try starting now.
