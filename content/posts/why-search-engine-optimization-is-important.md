**Visibility and Rankings**:

One of SEO’s main goals is to increase the visibility of your website, making it easier for users to find your website when searching for the services or the product you are selling.

Visibility is directly related to your site ranking. The higher you rank in a search engine result page (SERPs), the better chances users have of finding you and clicking through to your site to purchase your product or service.

The better your SEO efforts, the higher your ranking and visibility. Above are some of the main reason that Why Search Engine Optimization Is Important?.

**Web Traffic**:

One of the main goals of SEO is to increase your web traffic, and the way you do that is by improving visibility and ranking. Consider this for a moment: around 33% of clicks go to the first ranking page, and the top five listings get about 75% of the clicks.

Generally, if you want to be found by more prospects through search engines, you should follow SEO techniques to get among the top five positions, ideally number one.

**Authority**:

In SEO, authority is a relatively new concept, but it is becoming increasingly important to search engines as web users begin to value it more.

In essence, authority means that your site is trustworthy, relevant, and of high quality. The higher your authority, the higher your ranking, and the more trust you’ll earn from prospects.

**Trustworthy**:

Your SEO score determines how high you’ll appear on search engines like Google and Bing. While ranking higher on Google helps all brands because it increases visibility, a second benefit is a trust gained with potential customers.

Users rely on the recommendations that search engines provide, so ranking higher in the search engine results for their search term will solidify your product or service is trustworthy.

**Creating a Better User Experience**:

A fully optimized website clearly communicates what the product or service is and how to get it, as well as answering any questions concerning it. 

If a user struggle to navigate the site, chances are that so will the search engine. If the site is built with the user’s needs in mind, search engines will see that as well.

The other reason SEO is so important is because all the effort you put into creating high-quality content and optimizing your site with on-page SEO will make your site easier to use for your visitors, making the visitors’ experience seamless and enjoyable.

By making your site responsive, for example, it will be accessible to everyone who visits the site on a mobile device, whether or not they are also connected via a laptop or desktop. 

A faster page load speed also reduces bounce rates and lets users stay on the site longer. About 50% of consumers expect a page to load within two seconds, and the longer the loading time, the higher the bounce rate and the lower the conversions.

**Growth**:

Ultimately, SEO is very important because it helps you achieve many of your business goals. 

With the help of SEO, you can build better relationships with your customers, improve the customer experience, increase your authority, drive more traffic to your site, beat the competition, and increase conversions, which means more sales, more loyal customers, and more business growth for your business.

You can’t deny it – SEO is key to the growth of your brand. The higher your organic page rank is on a search engine, the more traffic your site will receive on an ongoing basis. It’s that simple.

**Final Thoughts:**

You can see that SEO is a complex task that involves many different techniques, tactics, and best practices. Furthermore, these best practices are constantly evolving as consumer and web-user behaviors change, as new technologies emerge, and as search engines change their algorithms. 

However, SEO remains an important part of any business who wishes to be visible on the web, in this regard, your efforts are more than worthwhile.
