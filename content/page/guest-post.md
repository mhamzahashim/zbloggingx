## Step 3: Guidelines:

Include relevant links in your article. But it should be promotional. I will only allow those who are doing the same work as me like I’m running a blog you should also have a blog, not a company to promote your services.

**Guidelines for Article:**

* The article should be over **1200 words.** Original content only, please.!
* We will work together on **editing your article** and coming up with the headline. I never want to rob the writer of their voice, but I do have high standards for the content that I post on this blog.
* I hold the right to publish the content in line with my content schedule. I will tell you when it will most likely be published.
* I will choose a picture that I believe is relevant to your blog post. You may send me a suggestion, but I hold the final say in the featured image.
* In return, you can also add one link to your website but that will be **nofollow**, if you need **dofollow** you have to pay $20

**Note:** I will not accept any promotional content. You have to submit a request for the advertisement. After reviewing your content I will tell you about that.
